            The User agrees that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, service providers
            may cancel or refuse services for reasons including health risks,
            lack of vaccination, refusal to follow safety norms, or government
            restrictions.

          <p className="mt-3">
            Goibibo shall not be liable for such refusals. Refunds, if any, will
            depend on the end service provider’s policy.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-3">
            The User must follow all government-issued SOPs, including wearing
            protective gear, providing health declarations, or showing
            vaccination certificates. Non-compliance may lead to denial of
            travel or entry, and Goibibo will not be responsible for any such
            consequences.
