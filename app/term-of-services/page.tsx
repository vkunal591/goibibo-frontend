              Terms of the Airlines
            </h2>
            <p>
              The airline tickets available through the Website are subject to
              the terms & conditions of the concerned airline, including but not
              limited to cancellation and refund policies. Goibibo merely acts
              as a facilitator to enable the User to book a flight ticket. The
              contract of service for utilization of the flight is always
              between the User and the concerned airline.
            </p>
            <p>
              Airlines retain the right to reschedule flight times, routes,
              change or cancel flights or itineraries independent of and without
              prior intimation to Goibibo. As a facilitator, Goibibo has no
              control or authority over the logistics of the airlines and
              therefore is not liable for any loss, direct or incidental, that a
              User may incur due to such change or cancellation of a flight.
            </p>
            <p>
              Different tickets on the same airline may carry different
              restrictions or include different services and price. The baggage
              allowance on a given fare is as per the terms decided by the
              airline, and Goibibo has no role to play in the same.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some of the fares shown in the booking flow are “hand baggage
              fares” which do not entitle the User for free check-in baggage and
              therefore the User will be required to pay separately for check-in
              baggage. The prices for adding check-in baggage to a booking may
              vary from airline to airline. The User is advised to contact the
              airlines for detailed costs.

              Code Share
            </h2>
            <p>
              Some airlines enter into "code share" agreements with other
              airlines. This means that on certain routes, the airline carrier
              selling or marketing the flight ticket does not fly its own
              aircraft to that destination. Instead, it contracts or partners
              with another airline to fly to that destination. The partner
              airline is listed as "operated by" in the booking flow.
            </p>
            <p>
              If your flight is a code share, it will be disclosed to you in the
              booking process and prior to payment. Goibibo will disclose any
              such code-share arrangements to the User, only when the ticketing
              airline discloses it to Goibibo in the first place.

              Pricing
            </h2>
            <p>
              The total price displayed on the Website on the payment page
              usually includes base fare, applicable government taxes, and
              convenience fee. Users are required to pay the entire amount prior
              to the confirmation of their booking(s). In the event the User
              does not pay the entire amount, Goibibo reserves its right to
              cancel the booking. User agrees to pay all statutory taxes,
              surcharges, and fees, as applicable on the date of travel.
            </p>
            <p>
              To avail infant fares, the age of the child must be under 24
              months throughout the entire itinerary. If the infant is 24 months
              or above on the return journey, the User will be required to make
              a separate booking using a child fare. Any infants or children
              must be accompanied by an adult as per the terms of the airlines.

              receiving the same from the airlines. However, the convenience fee

            <p>
              All cancellations made directly with the airline need to be

              The processing time for refunds may vary depending on the mode of
              payment, bank etc. The refund shall be processed after deducting
              the Goibibo service fee which is independent of the convenience
              fee as mentioned above.
            </p>
            <p>
              The refund will be credited to the same account from which the

              with the hotel. Goibibo shall not be liable for such
              discrepancies.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Hotel Information and Voucher</h3>
            <p>
              The booking voucher issued by Goibibo is based on the inventory
              and details provided by the hotel. Goibibo cannot be held liable
              for a hotel’s failure to accommodate a confirmed booking, for
              deficiencies in service, or for any other hotel-related issues.
              In the event of denial of check-in — including but not limited to
              overbooking, technical errors, or room unavailability — Goibibo’s
              liability is limited to, at Goibibo’s discretion, either:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mt-2">
              <li>Offering an alternative accommodation of similar standard (subject to availability), or</li>
              <li>Refunding the booking amount paid by the User (to the extent received).</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-2">
              Any other service-related complaints should be resolved directly
              between the User and the hotel.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Right of Admission</h3>
            <p>
              Hotels retain the sole right of admission. Certain hotels may have
              policies that restrict check-in for unmarried or unrelated couples,
              local residents, or guests unable to present valid identification.
              Goibibo is not responsible for any denial of check-in by the
              hotel and no refund shall be payable in such circumstances.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Responsibilities of the User</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mt-2">
              <li>The User is liable for any damage caused to hotel property by the User or their guests; the hotel will determine the extent and amount of the damage.</li>
              <li>The primary guest must be at least 18 years old to check in.</li>
              <li>Valid government-issued identity proof and address proof must be presented at check-in; the hotel may deny check-in without proper documentation.</li>
              <li>Check-in and check-out times are determined by hotel policy; early check-in or late check-out is subject to availability and may incur additional charges payable directly to the hotel.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Additional Charges by the Hotel</h3>
            <p>
              The booking amount covers only accommodation and any meals
              explicitly included at the time of booking. Additional services
              such as laundry, room service, internet, telephone charges, extra
              meals or beverages are payable directly to the hotel. Hotels may
              levy mandatory surcharges for special dates or festivals, which
              must be settled with the hotel.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Payment Models</h3>
            <p>
              Hotels may offer bookings on a “Prepaid” or “Pay at Hotel” basis:
            </p>
            <div className="ml-4 mt-2">
              <p className="font-semibold">Prepaid</p>
              <p>
                The full booking amount, including room charges, applicable
                taxes and any service or convenience fees, is paid at the time
                of reservation. In some cases partial payment may be accepted
                with the balance payable under the booking terms. Goibibo may
                cancel a booking if payment or card details provided are found
                to be invalid. Any bank or card issuer fees (including foreign
                transaction fees) are the User’s responsibility.
              </p>

              <p className="font-semibold mt-3">Pay at Hotel</p>
              <p>
                The hotel collects the booking amount at check-in. For
                international bookings, the hotel may charge in local currency or
                another currency as determined by the hotel. Hotels may require
                a credit card pre-authorization or a cash deposit at check-in to
                cover incidental charges; such deposits are separate from any
                payment via Goibibo.
              </p>
            </div>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Third-Party Links</h3>
            <p>
              The Website may contain links to third-party sites. Goibibo does
              not control such sites and is not responsible for their content or
              accuracy. Accessing third-party websites is at the User’s own
              risk and Goibibo disclaims liability for losses or damages arising
              from their use. Users should independently verify any information
              obtained from external websites.
